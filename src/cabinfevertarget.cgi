# As I have noted for many years, *when* I go to Hell for the many
# things I have done to probably deserve it, I will be perpetually
# in a room with Printers, with a healthy side dose of OpenSSL.

# Enough with wonky printerscaled images in pdf files as targets that
# we never are super sure of what's what. Surely there is a way to
# make a consistent sized circle on a page. We should be able to just
# do this by ah.. drawing a circle of the right size for the right
# distance.. (and don't call me Shirley).
#
# It would also be darn nice if the competitor stapling up the target
# at their range, and the div leaders looking at it, could have a
# visual confirmation this was the correctly scaled target for the
# division, and distance they were shooting at, and even how big we
# believe the target *should* be at that range so the shooter
# can indeed confirm their printer did not screw them before
# shooting at the target.
#
# All the shooter need know is:
# 1) What division
# 2) What distance, and what units they want to shoot at
# 3) What paper (Letter or A4) they want to print the target on.
#
# All we need to decide is the miniumum and max distance each
# division may be shot at. This allows a competitor with access
# to perhaps, a 40 yard only indoor range, to still shoot the
# CFC divisions at 40 yards with a correctly scaled target,
# which is then easily confirmed by the div leader that "yep
# they say they are shooting at 40 yards, and they are using the
# official 40 yard scaled target."
#
# Currently we only link targets for a few distances because
# the links to many static pdf files are bit of a pain, and
# hard for both us and shooters to decipher.
#
# I propose instead to replace with one "get a target" link to a web
# form that runs this underneath, enabling a shooter to shoot at *any*
# distance between our set max and minumums for the division, with a
# correctly sized target.
#
# And don't whine that it's perl, the "Talk Glock but carry a J frame"
# of the tech world.

# Helpful constants.

# PDF natively uses a point size of 72 per inch, so all coordinates are
# done based on that.
# Target is an 8 inch (203mm) circle at 100M, therefore a 4 inch radius
use constant R8 => (4 * 72);
# Target is an 4 inch (102mm) circle at 50M, therefore a 2 inch radius
use constant R4 => (2 * 72);

# When scaling, we convert everythig to metric.
use constant mm => 25.4 / 72;
use constant YardsPerMetre => 0.9144;

# Things to warm the hearts of old rifle nerds which we may or may
# not choose to use.
use constant ArshinPerMeter => 0.7112;
# seems the standard Austrian Value. The KuK kept the Schritt on rifle
# sights until the very end. 
use constant SchrittPerMeter => 0.7586;
# Prussian Schritt were 2 Fuss 4 Zoll - so 0.7322 metres.
# https://books.google.de/books?id=12pnAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false
# https://books.google.de/books?id=AEkIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA95#v=onepage&q&f=false
# This is also confusing because before unification nobody in the
# German states could agree on the length of a Fuss. This comment is
# kept here for posterity, but I think we'll just stick to a Schritt
# from Austria, since the German states went metric in the 1860's. A
# Division 4 entry with a Dreyse wanting a to shoot target in Schritt
# for cool factor can probably just treat them the same given the
# distances involved, and the lack of match grade ammunition for
# sub-MOA Dreyse shooting.
