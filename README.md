Cabin Fever Challenge Targets

This is not real or official yet. It is just me being
[nerdsniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by a problem.

Don't use this.

Having said that, this is currently code to generate cabin fever challenge
scaled correctly for any distance, and printer, based upon the cabin fever
challenge division.

The intent would be to hook this up to a web form we need only one
link for shooters to get an official target pdf. The shooter would
input what division they wanted to shoot, what distance and units of
measure they wanted to shoot it at, and what paper their printer used.

Therefore If I knew I wanted to shoot Division 2, at 75 yards, and I
had printer using A4 paper, I could just put in those parameters and
get a pdf to print a correct target for that distance.

For current output see the samples directory - normally we would not
keep anything like a bunch of these pregenerated files aroud, this
is just for testing.

For the code look in the src directory

I have not yet hooked this up with a web front end to let a shooter
just generate targets. It's not hard, but I'll do that if and when I
know it generates correct stuff, and the CFC decides it actually wants
to use this method, which might not be this year.
